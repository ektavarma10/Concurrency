# Concurrency

This repository contains Java implementations of solutions to common concurrency problems. These solutions are provided as examples for working with multi-threading and synchronization in Java. 

## Prerequisite 
* Java 
* Basics of Concurrency(Mutex, Semaphore, Synchronise blocks)

## Problem Description 

* **[Reader-Writer Problem](https://github.com/naruto-4/Concurrency/blob/main/ReaderWriterProblem.java)** - Solution to synchronise threads for n-reader and n-writer problem.
* **[Dining-Philosopher Problem](https://github.com/naruto-4/Concurrency/blob/main/DiningPhilosopherProblem.java)** - Implementation of classic Dining philosopher using Semaphores.
* **[Uber Riber Problem](https://github.com/naruto-4/Concurrency/blob/main/UberRiderProblem.java)** - Design a system wherein rides need to be an acceptable combination of riders. For given problem I have assumed even number of passengers wherein all riders can either be Type A or Type B or half of both.
